# OLTP vs OLAP

OLTP(Online Transaction Processing):
Purpose: To manage and process day-to-day transactions in real-time. 

Characteristics: 
Optimized for high-volume, fast transactions involving small amounts of data per transaction (e.g., one record). 
Focuses on the current state of the data. 
Designed for frequent inserts, updates, and deletes. 
Used by frontline workers and customers for operational tasks. 
Examples: Banking transactions, e-commerce order processing, airline reservations. 

OLAP (Online Analytical Processing):
Purpose: To enable complex analysis of large volumes of historical data. 

Characteristics:
Optimized for complex, read-heavy queries that aggregate large amounts of data. 
Focuses on historical and aggregated data to support business intelligence and decision-making. 
Uses multidimensional data cubes to allow for "slicing," "dicing," and "pivoting" data. 
Used by data analysts, data scientists, and business intelligence professionals. 
Examples: Analyzing sales trends over several years, forecasting future sales, or identifying customer buying patterns.
