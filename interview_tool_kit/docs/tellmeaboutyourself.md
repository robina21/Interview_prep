I have been a data engineer for the past 8 years.

My work has been majorly focussed on building data pipelines from diff data sources and loading them into aws redshift.
I have worked on a lot of ETL using Airflow and Talend and informatica. Managing pipelines debugging them and fixing them. I have worked with python, sql and pyspark for transformations 

I have also worked on azure for sometime basically on adf to build pipelines and currently am working with talend, aws services like steo fun, redshift, glue and all that.
