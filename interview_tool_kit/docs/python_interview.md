# Python Interview Questions for Data Engineers

## üß† Basics

**Q1. What are Python's key features?**  
- Interpreted, dynamically typed, object-oriented, open-source, and has extensive libraries.


**Q2. What‚Äôs the difference between `is` and `==` in Python?**  
- `==` compares values, `is` checks identity (memory location).

**Q3. How do you swap two variables without a temporary variable?**
```python
a, b = b, a
```

**Q4. What's the difference between a list and a tuple?**  
- Lists are mutable; tuples are immutable and faster.


**Q5. What's the difference between append and extend ?**
-  Append adds object to the end of list = [1,2,3,[4,5]]
-  Extend adds individual objects to the list at the end

**Q20. What is a Python decorator?**
```python
def decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before")
        func()
        print("After")
    return wrapper
```

**Q21. How do you read a large file without loading into memory?**
```python
with open('large.csv') as f:
    for line in f:
        process(line)
```

**Q22. What is the GIL in Python?**  
- Global Interpreter Lock prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once.
