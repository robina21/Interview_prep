# SQL Interview Questions for Data Engineers

## üßæ Basic Queries

**Q1. What is the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`?**  
- `WHERE` filters rows before grouping; `HAVING` filters groups after aggregation.

**Q2. How do you fetch only unique values from a column?**  
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;
```

**Q3. How to get the second highest salary from an employee table?**  
```sql

```

**Q4. How do you rename a column in the result set?**  
```sql

## üìê Subqueries & CTEs

**Q11. What is a CTE and when would you use it?**  
- A Common Table Expression makes complex queries more readable and reusable.

**Q12. Write a query using a CTE to get top 5 salaries.**  
```sql
WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT name, salary,
         DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
  FROM employees
)
SELECT * FROM ranked WHERE rank <= 5;
```

**Q13. How to use a correlated subquery?**  
```sql
SELECT name FROM employees e
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = e.department);
```

## ü™ü Window Functions

**Q14. How to calculate running total of salaries?**  
```sql
SELECT name, salary,
       SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY name) AS running_total
FROM employees;
```

WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
```

**Q18. How to delete duplicate records but keep one?**  
```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT MIN(id)
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY name, department
);
```

**Q19. What are indexes and why are they used?**  
- Indexes speed up read queries by allowing faster lookup but slow down inserts/updates.

**Q20. How to find null values in a column?**  
```sql
