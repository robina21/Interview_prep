What are Python's key features? - Interpreted, dynamically typed, object-oriented, open-source, and has extensive libraries. Q2. What\u2019s the difference between is and == in Python? - == compares values, is checks identity (memory location). Q3. How do you swap two variables without a temporary variable? a, b = b, a Q4. What's the difference between a list and a tuple? - Lists are mutable; tuples are immutable and faster. \ud83e\uddf1 Data Structures & Algorithms Q5. How do you implement a queue in Python? from collections import deque queue = deque() queue.append('a') queue.popleft() Q6. How to find duplicates in a list? seen = set() dupes = [x for x in lst if x in seen or seen.add(x)] Q7. What is a dictionary and how is it used? - Key-value mapping. Fast lookups using hash tables. Q8. How do you sort a dictionary by values? sorted_dict = dict(sorted(my_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])) \ud83d\udd04 Loops & Comprehensions Q9. What is a list comprehension? [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0] Q10. What is a generator? def gen(): for i in range(5): yield i \ud83d\uddc3\ufe0f File Handling & Error Handling Q11.
